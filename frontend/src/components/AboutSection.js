            <p>
                                    I'm a software engineer who is passionate about making code more accessible, creating technology to elevate people, and building community. Some technologies I enjoy working with include chatbots, the MERN (Mongo, Express, React and Node) stack and PHP. I am currently working on an awesome startup called Proposify.
